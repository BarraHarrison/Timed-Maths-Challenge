# Timed-Maths-Challenge
This Python program is a timed math challenge where the user is presented with a series of arithmetic problems. The goal is to solve a set number of problems (10 by default) as quickly as possible. The user’s performance is measured by the time taken to complete the problems and the number of incorrect attempts made.

This Python program is a timed math challenge where users solve 10 random arithmetic problems as quickly as possible.
The program generates problems using random operators (+, -, *) and operands within a defined range.

After the user starts the challenge, the time taken to solve all problems is recorded.
Users must input the correct answer to proceed to the next problem, with any incorrect attempts being tracked.

The challenge ends when all problems are correctly solved, and the total time taken is displayed, providing immediate feedback on the user’s performance.
This makes the program both educational and engaging.
