# Timed-Maths-Challenge
This Python program is a timed math challenge where the user is presented with a series of arithmetic problems. The goal is to solve a set number of problems (10 by default) as quickly as possible. The userâ€™s performance is measured by the time taken to complete the problems and the number of incorrect attempts made.
